    This article is unconvincing.

From the article: Compared to the first snippet, this one is harder to debug. It seems so because 1.) You don't know that callMe will throw an error or not. 2.) If it throws an exception you will not know what is the type of the exception. The more modular your code is, the harder it is to debug exceptions.
